Robin Edens Assignment 4 - CSIS 252
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a followup to Assignment 4 that deals with creating a 
class the same as we did in Assignment 5 and replaces the struct with
an Object Oriented approach for using constructors, getters, and setters
to access the Unit, while also making it open enough to be useable for
any of the units that were submitted for Assignment 1. 


Input follows the same as Assignment 2-4, where a file is read from the 
argument passed when executing the program (test case file is named
"conversion, so prog6 conversion would run the project". Once this is 
done, as before, input is received by the user entering two units of
measurement separated by whitespace (e.g. 'foot meter') that are in
the passed file, and the program checks to see if the units can be
converted between.

Output will consist of the output of the console to give a user-friendly
layout and the results of the comparison between the two units that are
given by the user.
